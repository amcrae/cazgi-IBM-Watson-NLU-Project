# IBM/Coursera "Developing Cloud Apps with Node.js and React"
## Week 5 Final Project

Author: Andrew McRae

### Status
Work in progress.

### Note on using github from cognitiveclass.ai cloud development environment.
GitHub were trying to disable the use of passwords for git and move everybody to SSH keys only. IBM's course instructions still specify to clone and push via HTTPS. 
I tested a git push via HTTPS from Theia, and after being asked for the github account password, it worked. So this works at the moment.

Some extra steps (found via StackOverflow of course) which make this online development easier are:
>  `git config credential.helper store`  
>  `git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 7200'`  

Which means I don't get prompted for the password more than once every 2 hours.
