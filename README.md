# IBM/Coursera "Developing Cloud Apps with Node.js and React"
## Week 5 Final Project

### Repo Note
GitHub were trying to disable the use of passwords for git and move everybody to SSH keys only. IBM's instructions still specificy to clone and push via HTTPS. 
So initially I'm just testing a git push via HTTPS from Theia. If this doesn't work, I would rather not have my SSH private key file in Theia, so I may have to work from my own PC instead of Theia so I can push by GIT protocol and SSH key authentication.
